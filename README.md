# libguides-customization
Backups for customization files in LibGuides CMS. 

## Please note:
These files were created for copy-and-paste into the SpringShare LibGuides environment. The idiosyncrasies of this platform mean that the files don't work in this codespace the way they do within Libguides (for example, styles are applied within a specific dialog there and not referenced directly from custom HTML). If using these files to test code outside of the LibGuides environment, please make copies rather than altering these files to interact properly.
